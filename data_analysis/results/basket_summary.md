# Fama-French + Beta Model Stock Baskets

This document provides a summary of the 5 stock baskets created using the Fama-French + Beta factor model.

## Model Description

Our Fama-French + Beta model analyzes stocks based on the following factors:

1. **Market Beta**: Measures sensitivity to market movements
2. **Size Factor (SMB)**: Exposure to small vs. large capitalization stocks
3. **Value Factor (HML)**: Exposure to value vs. growth characteristics
4. **Alpha**: Risk-adjusted excess returns

The model creates a composite risk score based on these factors and groups stocks into 5 baskets ranging from low risk to high risk. Each basket is then assigned risk and return ratings to help investors select baskets that match their investment objectives.

## Basket Characteristics

| Basket | Name | Risk Rating | Return Rating | Avg Beta | Volatility | Expected Return | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|---------------|----------|------------|-----------------|-------------|
| 1 | Low Risk / Defensive | Very Low | Moderate-High | -1.30 | 5.00% | 12.94% | Stocks with negative beta that often move opposite to the market. Low volatility with strong defensive characteristics. |
| 2 | Moderate-Low Risk / Stable Growth | Low | Low | -0.55 | 5.00% | -0.61% | Low volatility stocks with slightly negative market correlation, providing stability with limited growth. |
| 3 | Moderate Risk / Balanced | Moderate | Low | 0.001 | 5.00% | 3.68% | Well-balanced stocks with minimal market sensitivity, providing steady but modest returns. |
| 4 | Moderate-High Risk / Growth | High | Low | 0.44 | 6.57% | -15.45% | Stocks with positive market correlation that typically follow market movements with higher volatility. |
| 5 | High Risk / Aggressive Growth | Very High | Low | 1.36 | 20.39% | -0.53% | High beta stocks with strong market sensitivity that amplify market movements in both directions. |

## Investment Applications

These baskets can be used for:

1. **Diversification**: Create a balanced portfolio using stocks from different baskets
2. **Risk Management**: Adjust exposure based on market conditions
3. **Goal-Based Investing**: Match baskets to specific investment objectives
4. **Tactical Allocation**: Increase or decrease risk exposure based on market outlook

## Selection Methodology

Stocks are ranked based on their factor exposures:

1. **Market Beta**: Higher beta means more market risk
2. **SMB Factor**: Higher exposure means more sensitivity to small-cap stocks
3. **HML Factor**: Higher exposure means more sensitivity to value stocks
4. **Alpha**: Indicator of risk-adjusted excess return

The composite risk score is then calculated using a weighted combination of these factors, with Beta carrying the most weight.

## Risk-Return Implications

- **Basket 1**: Tends to perform well in market downturns but may underperform in strong bull markets
- **Basket 2**: Offers stability with modest growth potential
- **Basket 3**: Balanced performance across market cycles
- **Basket 4**: Tends to move with the market but with amplified returns and volatility
- **Basket 5**: Highest potential returns in bull markets but also highest risk of losses in downturns

## Conclusion

The Fama-French + Beta model provides a structured approach to categorizing stocks based on their risk factors and expected returns. By dividing the S&P 500 universe into these five baskets, investors can more effectively match their investments to their risk tolerance and return objectives.
