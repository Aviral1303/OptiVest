# OptiVest Stock Basket Analysis: Executive Summary

## Introduction

OptiVest's proprietary stock basket methodology provides investors with a systematic approach to categorizing stocks based on their risk characteristics and expected returns. Using a multi-factor model based on the Fama-French framework with additional beta analysis, we have created five distinct stock baskets that offer different risk-return profiles for various investor preferences.

## Methodology

Our approach employs a modified Fama-French three-factor model combined with beta analysis to identify stocks with similar risk-return characteristics. The methodology analyzes the following key risk factors:

- **Market Beta (β)**: Measures a stock's sensitivity to market movements
- **Size Factor (SMB)**: Captures the risk premium associated with smaller companies
- **Value Factor (HML)**: Reflects the risk premium for value stocks over growth stocks
- **Alpha (α)**: Represents excess return beyond what would be predicted by the model

## The Five Stock Baskets

Each basket contains 7 stocks with weights that sum to 100%, providing focused exposure to carefully selected securities:

## Key Insights

Our analysis reveals several important insights:

1. **Positive Risk-Return Relationship**: Higher-risk baskets generally offer higher expected returns, with returns ranging from 8.0% to 16.0% and return ratings from 3/5 to 5/5.
2. **Beta Progression**: Beta increases systematically across baskets from 0.52 (Basket 1) to 1.53 (Basket 5).
3. **Factor Loading Patterns**: Each basket shows distinct factor loading patterns that explain its risk-return characteristics.
4. **Diversification Potential**: The baskets provide different risk-return profiles, enabling effective portfolio diversification.

## Portfolio Applications

These stock baskets can be applied in portfolio management in various ways:

### Strategic Asset Allocation
Combine baskets to create portfolios with your preferred risk-return profile:
- **Conservative Mix**: 50% Basket 1 (Moderate Return), 30% Basket 2 (Moderate-High Return), 20% Basket 3 (High Return) (Expected Return: ~9.2%)
- **Balanced Mix**: 20% Basket 1, 30% Basket 2, 30% Basket 3, 20% Basket 4 (Very High Return) (Expected Return: ~10.6%)
